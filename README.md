# P1-Project-Image-Classification-by-Machine-learning--AICTE-Internship

## ML Model for Image Classification
This project is a Streamlit application that combines MobileNetV2 and a CIFAR-10 model to classify images. Users can upload their images and get predictions along with confidence scores from either model. The app features a clean navigation bar for easy model switching and provides real-time results, making it perfect for both learning and practical applications.

## Key Features
## Dual Model Support:
  - ## MobileNetV2 (ImageNet):
     - Identifies 1,000 distinct classes from the ImageNet dataset, including everyday objects, animals, and vehicles.
  - ## Custom CIFAR-10 Model: 
     - Focuses on classifying images into one of ten categories such as airplanes, automobiles, and birds.

## User-Friendly Interface:

- ## Navigation Bar: 
  - Effortlessly switch between MobileNetV2 and CIFAR-10 models using a streamlined sidebar menu.

- ## Instant Classification: 
  - Upload an image to receive immediate predictions along with confidence scores.

## Educational and Practical Use:

  - Excellent for learning about deep learning models and their performance.

  - Suitable for practical applications where image classification is needed.

  - Feel free to ask for further assistance or any modifications!
